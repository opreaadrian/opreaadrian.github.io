Hi, I'm Adrian and I'm a web developer with over 6 years of experience. I'm into sports, I like running and basketball, and when I'm (rarely) away from my computer I love to spend time with my daughter and my wife. Find out more about me/my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/opreageorgeadrian), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/opreaadrian), and [GitHub](https://github.com/opreaadrian).

Oh, and I really love JavaScript, Vim, HTML and the Open Web!
