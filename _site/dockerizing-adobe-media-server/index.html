    <p>New job, new technologies, new problems to solve — that’s how it all started for me.<br />
After switching jobs few months ago, I found myself working on an application that makes heavy use of
Adobe Media Server(AMS) for audio and video streaming.<br />
Nothing too hard, or too complicated, except for the fact that all developers were using a single
install of AMS which was somewhere on a central server.<br />
This started all my single-point-of-failure alarms, and started to ockerize the whole development
environment, including AMS. In this article, I will explain the steps I followed in order to
properly create a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> container running Adobe Media Server, with 
full RTMP/RTMPS support,</p>

<p>By now, many of the developers with an interest in DevOps should know about Docker, so I wont waste
time explaining what Docker is, there are plenty of resources out there, starting with the
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/">official docker documentation</a>, very rich in examples and explanations.</p>

<p>So, back to our AMS setup, there’s one “small” problem, setting it up inside a Docker container 
— it doesn’t work straight out of the box.<br />
This is because when you install Adobe Media Server, you get the application’s  license, <code class="highlighter-rouge">less</code>-ed 
to you, and you need to press the spacebar(or the down arrow if you feel a  bit crazy) and hit a 
key when you reach the bottom, confirming that you’ve read and agreed with the license.<br />
In my opinion, this is complicated stuff, so let’s simplify. As it turns out, just by going to the 
directory where the AMS archive is extracted, and removing “License.txt”, you can aviod having to 
“read” the whole license before continuing.<br />
So much for the first part of the problem. But there is still something to be done! The install
script is still waiting for user input, to continue with the setup, so what you have to do
next is to comment out the line that halts the  installation until it gets a keypress, in the 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">installAMS</code> script. For this matter in particular, you will need to use 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">sed</code></a>, just like in the snippet below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>ams_setup_directory
<span class="gp">$ </span>rm -Rf License.txt
<span class="gp">$ </span>sed -i -e <span class="s1">'s:read cont &lt; /dev/tty:#read cont &lt; /dev/tty:g'</span> installAMS
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After getting rid of the license, and the blocking keypress timeout, comes the normal setup, where
you have to provide various answers to the installer. This is where the second problem appears, as 
you aren’t able to answer those questions yourself, because everything takes place when you’re 
building your Docker image.<br />
At one point, when I was at my lowest self-esteem level of all times, somebody suggested using 
<a href="http://expect.sourceforge.net/">Expect</a> to autofill the answers, but I wasn’t in the mood for
reading at that time. Besides, I knew that it had to be simpler than that, and I was right.</p>

<p>The answer lies in the setup itself. What you have to do is to do is to open your editor, and 
manually go through the setup, while writing down each answer you put in (including <code class="highlighter-rouge">RETURN</code>s).
At the end of the setup you will have something looking like the snippet below 
(whitespace is relevant):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># begin input file</span>
      
n
/opt/adobe/ams 
admin
123456789
123456789
ams
y
ams
y
y

ams
1935,-443
1111
y
n
y
      
     
<span class="c"># end input file</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>that you can validate against AMS’s “Install Action Summary”, outlined below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>----------- Install Action Summary -----------

Installation directory         <span class="o">=</span> /opt/adobe/ams

Adobe Media Server Port        <span class="o">=</span> 1935,-443
Adobe Media Admin Server Port  <span class="o">=</span> 1111
Interface <span class="o">(</span>IP address<span class="o">)</span> AMS will listen on  <span class="o">=</span> auto

Apache Install                 <span class="o">=</span> Yes


Administrative username        <span class="o">=</span> admin
Administrative password        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span>suppressed<span class="o">)</span>

service owner                  <span class="o">=</span> ams

service user                   <span class="o">=</span> ams
service group                  <span class="o">=</span> ams

Run as daemon                  <span class="o">=</span> Yes
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, to make this work, all you have to do is to save that input file, somewhere on the filesystem 
of your container, and simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipe</code> it through <code class="highlighter-rouge">installAMS</code>. I would recommend naming the file 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">installAMS.input</code>, so you can easily identify which is which. After you’ve created your input file, 
all you need to do is to execute one of the following commands, in the directory where the AMS 
archive was extracted: <code class="highlighter-rouge">./installAMS &lt; installAMS.input</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat installAMS.input | ./installAMS</code>.</p>

<p>Having this knowledge under our belts, it’s pretty straightforward to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> with 
the afore-mentioned setup, and with a bit more effort, to have a fully isolated Adobe Media Server
install, easily reproducible from version control.<br />
Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> will probably look like the one below, with minor tweaks based on your needs:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>FROM centos:6
