    <meta name="description" itemprop="description" content="Working with mapped network drives in VIM? Me too! I always wondered why go through all this pain?
Because of this, I resorted to Sublime Text for this type of work, as it is very fast in most situations,
but I still dreaded the fact that I could not use Vim, as there have been some situations where I 
would have been much more productive and would have gotten to the bottom of the task way quicker if I could have used Vim instead of ST3.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I find Sublime Text awesome and really fast, and yes, I am aware of its Vintage Mode, but that just 
doesn&#39;t cut it for me. I can fake Vim in Sublime, but as far as I know, ST3&#39;s Vintage  doesn&#39;t allow you to create 
custom commands/mappings, the way you do in Vim, for example.

    <p>Working with mapped network drives in VIM? Me too! I always wondered why go through all this pain?<br>
Because of this, I resorted to Sublime Text for this type of work, as it is very fast in most situations,
but I still dreaded the fact that I could not use Vim, as there have been some situations where I 
would have been much more productive and would have gotten to the bottom of the task way quicker if I could have used Vim instead of ST3.<br>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I find Sublime Text awesome and really fast, and yes, I am aware of its Vintage Mode, but that just 
doesn&#39;t cut it for me. I can fake Vim in Sublime, but as far as I know, ST3&#39;s Vintage  doesn&#39;t allow you to create 
custom commands/mappings, the way you do in Vim, for example.</p>

<p>Back on track with the Vim part, I have been living with this pain for quite some time, 
until 3 days ago when I realised that I wasn&#39;t able to see the trees because of the forest.
I thought about all possible solutions, <code>scp</code> being the most reliable of them all.<br>
To clarify, I had no problem creating a bash function that would use <code>scp</code> to upload everything to the remote server, which I actually did it.
The only problem was that it would re-upload all the files and I didn&#39;t want that. 
Knowing this, I would rely on a trick I presented in 
<a href="http://codesi.nz/workflow/2015/06/15/short-tip-viewing-and-resolving-svn-conflicts-in-the-terminal.html">Short tip: viewing and resolving svn conflicts in the terminal</a>, 
namely, I would take the filenames from <code>svn status</code>, and upload them one by one &mdash; talk about thinking like a programmer. The result is in the snippet below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">function </span>scpsync<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nb">local </span><span class="nv">changed_files</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>svn status | awk <span class="s1">'{print $2}'</span><span class="k">)</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Syncing </span><span class="nv">$changed_files</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="k">for </span>file <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nv">$changed_files</span>; <span class="k">do
        </span>scp <span class="nv">$file</span> goprea@<span class="nv">$1</span>:/<span class="nv">$2</span>/<span class="nv">$file</span>
    <span class="k">done
    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Sync done</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, everything looked fine but I started hating it when I read the code out loud.
I had a function that would upload all my SVN modified files…every damn time! 
This meant that if I would commit once a day(SVN users know what I&#39;m talking about), 
I would upload every modified file, every time, even if I only changed the code ONCE, for some files.<br>
This is the part where the over-engineer in me felt like a million bucks.
I have created something that repeats a task even when it is not needed. Although it was ugly as hell, 
it was useful to me so I had to brag about it, but there was still a little voice in the back of my head, 
telling me that I once used a tool that would sync with the server through <code>ssh</code>, in a flawless manner.<br>
That&#39;s why I went to my co-worker <a href="https://github.com/pennycoders">Alex Pica</a>, as he has the eye of a critic and will argue with me over anything. 
After letting me brag about my absolutely marvellous function, he went something along the lines of: &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>?&quot;.<br>
At that moment I had the epiphany! That was the tool that I used in the past and does all the neat stuff I told you before, and more.<br>
I&#39;m writing this article to both share the solution with the Vim users going through the same pain I went to, and to thank Alex for being a walking encyclopedia.<br>
The solution is outlined below, and it can be used directly from within Vim by issuing the following command in the Vim command line &mdash; <code>:!syncremote . user@ip:/remote/path</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">syncremote <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  rsync -WavP --human-readable --progress <span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="nv">$2</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Cheers, and happy hacking!</p>
