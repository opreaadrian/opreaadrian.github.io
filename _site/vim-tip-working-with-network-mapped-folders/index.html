Me too! I always wondered why go through all this pain?<br /> Because of this, I resorted to Sublime Text for this type of work, as it is very fast in most situations, but I still dreaded the fact that I could not use Vim, as there have been some situations where I would have been much more productive and would have gotten to the bottom of the task way quicker if I could have used Vim instead of ST3.<br /> Don’t get me wrong, I find Sublime Text awesome and really fast, and yes, I am aware of its Vintage Mode, but that just doesn’t cut it for me. I can fake Vim in Sublime, but as far as I know, ST3’s Vintage doesn’t allow you to create custom commands/mappings, the way you do in Vim, for example.<p>Back on track with the Vim part, I have been living with this pain for quite some time, until 3 days ago when I realised that I wasn’t able to see the trees because of the forest. I thought about all possible solutions, <code class="highlighter-rouge">scp</code> being the most reliable of them all.<br /> To clarify, I had no problem creating a bash function that would use <code class="highlighter-rouge">scp</code> to upload everything to the remote server, which I actually did it. The only problem was that it would re-upload all the files and I didn’t want that. Knowing this, I would rely on a trick I presented in <a href="https://codesi.nz/short-tip-viewing-and-resolving-svn-conflicts-in-the-terminal/">Short tip: viewing and resolving svn conflicts in the terminal</a>, namely, I would take the filenames from <code class="highlighter-rouge">svn status</code>, and upload them one by one — talk about thinking like a programmer. The result is in the snippet below.<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">function </span>scpsync<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nb">local </span><span class="nv">changed_files</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>svn status | awk <span class="s1">'{print $2}'</span><span class="k">)</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Syncing </span><span class="nv">$changed_files</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="k">for </span>file <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nv">$changed_files</span>; <span class="k">do
        </span>scp <span class="nv">$file</span> goprea@<span class="nv">$1</span>:/<span class="nv">$2</span>/<span class="nv">$file</span>
    <span class="k">done
    </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Sync done</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, everything looked fine but I started hating it when I read the code out loud. I had a function that would upload all my SVN modified files…every damn time! This meant that if I would commit once a day(SVN users know what I’m talking about), I would upload every modified file, every time, even if I only changed the code ONCE, for some files.<br /> This is the part where the over-engineer in me felt like a million bucks. I have created something that repeats a task even when it is not needed. Although it was ugly as hell, it was useful to me so I had to brag about it, but there was still a little voice in the back of my head, telling me that I once used a tool that would sync with the server through <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, in a flawless manner.<br /> That’s why I went to my co-worker <a href="https://github.com/pennycoders">Alex Pica</a>, as he has the eye of a critic and will argue with me over anything. After letting me brag about my absolutely marvellous function, he went something along the lines of: “Well, why don’t you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>?”.<br /> At that moment I had the epiphany! That was the tool that I used in the past and does all the neat stuff I told you before, and more.<br /> I’m writing this article to both share the solution with the Vim users going through the same pain I went to, and to thank Alex for being a walking encyclopedia.<br /> The solution is outlined below, and it can be used directly from within Vim by issuing the following command in the Vim command line — <code class="highlighter-rouge">:!syncremote . user@ip:/remote/path</code><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>syncremote <span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  rsync -WavP --human-readable --progress <span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="nv">$2</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
