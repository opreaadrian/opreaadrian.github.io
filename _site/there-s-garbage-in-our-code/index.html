and they made the mistake of letting me speak, again.<br>
Last time I presented something, was in June, when I tried to teach developers how to be
lazy at work, and use their time intelligently &mdash; <a href="https://codesi.nz/a-different-look-at-nodejs-application-architecture/" target="_blank" title="Older article about Node.js application architecture">A different look at Node.js application architecture</a></p>

<p>This time, I took on a challenge bigger than myself: explaining to people what garbage collection
is, how does the garbage collector work behind the scenes, and what dog breeds they shouldn&#39;t own.<br>
Now, I don&#39;t know if it was a success or not, but we sure had a good time, and the audience was
kind enough not to ask any questions &mdash; not sure if it was because pizza arrived at the end of
my presentation or they were just being nice and didn&#39;t want to put me in difficulty.
I wrote this small article to thank the organisers for their courage and dedication in maintaining
this community and to the patient crowd that stood and listened to me rambling about garbage
collection algorithms and my Chinese Crested friend,
Sniffles.</p>

<p>The slides are available on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AdrianOprea3/theres-garbage-in-our-code" target="_blank" title="There's garbage in our code - SlideShare presentation">SlideShare</a>.<br>
Enjoy!</p>
