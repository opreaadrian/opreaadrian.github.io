In this article, you will find my answer to this question, as I intend to keep it as a reference for everybody interested in the subject. I&#39;d like to mention that writing this answer was highly beneficial for me, as I had to look back at my past and think about my actions and how they determined the path that I took in my career as a software development professional.
One thing worth mentioning is the fact that I don&#39;t yet consider myself an &quot;enterprise JavaScript developer&quot;, even though I have been called by that name. I&#39;m a software developer with a sweet tooth for JavaScript, that&#39;s it.

    <p>A week ago I saw a very interesting question on Quora, titled:  <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-to-become-an-enterprise-level-professional-in-JavaScript/">What should I do to become an enterprise level professional in JavaScript?</a>. In this article, you will find my answer to this question, as I intend to keep it as a reference for everybody interested in the subject. I&#39;d like to mention that writing this answer was highly beneficial for me, as I had to look back at my past and think about my actions and how they determined the path that I took in my career as a software development professional.
One thing worth mentioning is the fact that I don&#39;t yet consider myself an &quot;enterprise JavaScript developer&quot;, even though I have been called by that name. I&#39;m a software developer with a sweet tooth for JavaScript, that&#39;s it.</p>

<h2>The actual answer</h2>

<p>First and foremost let me start by saying that I met &quot;enterprise JavaScript&quot; developers who are not that skilled in JavaScript, simply because the &quot;enterprise&quot; limits all their creativity by being more restrictive in terms of technologies.
On the other hand, they tend to be good at overall architecture, they think a lot in terms of scalability and durability.</p>

<p>Now, on to the list:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn JavaScript. I mean it! Learn the language, how it works, what is lexical scoping, how do all the data types work.</li>
<li>Find some coding standards documents - there are quite a few - and take the gist from all of them(i&#39;ll provide a list at the end)</li>
<li>Learn some utility libraries like jQuery, lodash,  zepto</li>
<li>Learn object-oriented programming</li>
<li>Learn functional programming</li>
<li>Learn a framework or two - at least the basic concepts - Angular and React are good candidates for that.</li>
<li>Learn design pattenrs - <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">Essential JavaScript Design patterns by Addy Osmani</a></li>
<li>Look at the frameworks again, from a different perspective, that of the implementation</li>
<li>Learn how to optimize for performance, in the browser</li>
<li>Learn NodeJS, if you plan on going full stack</li>
<li>Find some interesting, open source projects that you can work on, or create your own.</li>
<li>Read a lot of code - get a project that you like and simply observe the structure, the patterns, the coding style.</li>
<li>Write a lot of code - nothing sticks unless you use it, reading is not enough, you need to write JavaScript, day-in-day-out</li>
<li>Be humble. Don&#39;t think that if you know a lot, you&#39;re better than others. We tend to fall into this trap too often.</li>
<li>Share your knowledge. Blog, tweet, go to meetups and give presentations do podcasting, whatever your preferred method of expression is
Here are some resources to get you on your way:</li>

</ul>

<p>One last thing: don&#39;t go learning everything out there in terms of frameworks, if you&#39;re not planning on using them.
You will only waste precious time and memory on useless stuff. Set small(reaaaaally small) achievable goals for yourself and make sure you stick to them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
