In this article, you will find my answer to this question, as I intend to keep it as a reference for everybody interested in the subject. I’d like to mention that writing this answer was highly beneficial for me, as I had to look back at my past and think about my actions and how they determined the path that I took in my career as a software development professional.

On the other hand, they tend to be good at overall architecture, they think a lot in terms of scalability and durability.<p>Now, on to the list:<ol><li>Learn JavaScript. I mean it! Learn the language, how it works, what is lexical scoping, how do all the data types work.<li>Find some coding standards documents - there are quite a few - and take the gist from all of them(i’ll provide a list at the end)<li>Learn some utility libraries like jQuery, lodash, zepto<li>Learn object-oriented programming<li>Learn functional programming<li>Learn a framework or two - at least the basic concepts - Angular and React are good candidates for that.<li>Learn design pattenrs - <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">Essential JavaScript Design patterns by Addy Osmani</a><li>Look at the frameworks again, from a different perspective, that of the implementation<li>Learn how to optimize for performance, in the browser<li>Learn NodeJS, if you plan on going full stack<li>Find some interesting, open source projects that you can work on, or create your own.<li>Read a lot of code - get a project that you like and simply observe the structure, the patterns, the coding style.<li>Write a lot of code - nothing sticks unless you use it, reading is not enough, you need to write JavaScript, day-in-day-out<li>Be humble. Don’t think that if you know a lot, you’re better than others. We tend to fall into this trap too often.<li>Share your knowledge. Blog, tweet, go to meetups and give presentations do podcasting, whatever your preferred method of expression is Here are some resources to get you on your way:</ol><p><strong>Books:</strong><ul><li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript, the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford</a><li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781118026694.do">Professional JavaScript for web developers</a><li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805531.do">JavaScript The definitive Guide by David Flanagan</a><li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025245.do">Maintainable JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas</a></ul><p><strong>Blogs:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.nczonline.net">Nicholas Zakas</a><li><a href="http://www.2ality.com/">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</a><li><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">Sitepoint</a><li><a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a><li><a href="https://www.airpair.com">AirPair</a><li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/">Nicolas Bevacqua</a><li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a></ul><p><strong>Style guides:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml">Google’s JavaScript style guide</a><li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">AirBnB’s JavaScript style guide</a><li><a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/">IdiomaticJS</a><li><a href="https://github.com/styleguide/javascript">Github’s style guide</a></ul><p><strong>Online training:</strong><ul><li><a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a><li><a href="http://egghead.io">egghead.io</a><li><a href="https://www.bento.io/">Bento.io</a><li><a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/">Envato Tuts+ Free Code Tutorials</a><li><a href="http://superherojs.com/">SuperheroJS</a><li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a></ul><p><strong>Podcasts</strong><ul><li>An article I wrote : <a href="https://codesi.nz/my-favorite-podcasts/">My favorite podcasts</a><li><a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/great-podcasts">A git repository with interesting dev podcasts</a> - feel free to contribute</ul><p>One last thing: don’t go learning everything out there in terms of frameworks, if you’re not planning on using them.
