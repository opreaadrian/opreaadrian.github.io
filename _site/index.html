          <p>Understanding the way AJAX and JSON manipulation work in JavaScript could make 
the difference between writing an elegant, easy to reason about application, 
and a crude hack. As far as my experience goes, only a small number of developers 
I’ve talked to in the past year or so, know how to write a vanilla 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code>, from scratch. I do agree that it is important to get the 
job done in a timely manner and not reinvent the wheel, but using something 
without understanding it’s substance is something that I cannot come to terms 
with, for someone other than a junior developer.</p>

          <p>A week ago I saw a very interesting question on Quora, titled:  <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-to-become-an-enterprise-level-professional-in-JavaScript/">What should I do to become an enterprise level professional in JavaScript?</a>. In this article, you will find my answer to this question, as I intend to keep it as a reference for everybody interested in the subject. I’d like to mention that writing this answer was highly beneficial for me, as I had to look back at my past and think about my actions and how they determined the path that I took in my career as a software development professional.
One thing worth mentioning is the fact that I don’t yet consider myself an “enterprise JavaScript developer”, even though I have been called by that name. I’m a software developer with a sweet tooth for JavaScript, that’s it.</p>

          <p>I don’t know about you but I’m working with JavaScript all day long and I always trip over arrays
when it comes to “what method for which use case”. 
Whether I need to get an element from an array, check if an element exists or just create a new 
array, I always fail to remember which method does what, and of course, what each of the methods
return.<br />
This post is the first of a series of bite-sized(like the title states) posts aimed to first of all
remind me what each method of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Array</code> object does, and to also share this knowledge with anyone
interested in the topic. The articles won’t require more than a basic experience with JavaScript’s
syntax so absolute JavaScript beginners are welcomed, too.</p>

          <p>There comes a time in a developer’s life when they need to unlearn something, in order to make way
for something new. In fact, I believe that the right way to learn something new, be it a new
programming technique, a new framework, a new language, sometimes means putting some concepts that
you already know and master, behind you.</p>

          <p>New job, new technologies, new problems to solve — that’s how it all started for me.<br />
After switching jobs few months ago, I found myself working on an application that makes heavy use of
Adobe Media Server(AMS) for audio and video streaming.<br />
Nothing too hard, or too complicated, except for the fact that all developers were using a single
install of AMS which was somewhere on a central server.<br />
This started all my single-point-of-failure alarms, and started to ockerize the whole development
environment, including AMS. In this article, I will explain the steps I followed in order to
properly create a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> container running Adobe Media Server, with 
full RTMP/RTMPS support,</p>

          <p>Working with mapped network drives in VIM? Me too! I always wondered why go through all this pain?<br />
Because of this, I resorted to Sublime Text for this type of work, as it is very fast in most situations,
but I still dreaded the fact that I could not use Vim, as there have been some situations where I
would have been much more productive and would have gotten to the bottom of the task way quicker if I could have used Vim instead of ST3.<br />
Don’t get me wrong, I find Sublime Text awesome and really fast, and yes, I am aware of its Vintage Mode, but that just
doesn’t cut it for me. I can fake Vim in Sublime, but as far as I know, ST3’s Vintage  doesn’t allow you to create
custom commands/mappings, the way you do in Vim, for example.</p>

          <p>I’ve always loved to call myself different names/titles. I’ve been a software engineer, I’ve even been a “Lead Senior Front End Developer”; that’s a mouthful, isn’t it?. 
Titles are what make people feel important in their social environment. Certain people could argue that we’re rational beings, and we have values, and they’re right. 
But for the majority of us, the “name” we’re called by, is deeply engrained in our self-worth. I’ve experienced this countless times.</p>

          <p>Working with SVN for the past couple of years has taught me a lot in terms of how I don’t want a version control system to be. Unfortunately, many of the customers and companies I’ve worked with/for have had their entire codebase on SVN, and very often I’ve found myself in the situation where, after a simple merge, I’d get tons of conflicts, either related to whitespace, or a specific piece of code that changes between releases (app version, for example).</p>

In this article, I’ll go over my research for a better commit message “framework”(everything is a framework these days) and how I managed to solve the “I don’t know what I had for lunch yesterday, how am I supposed to know what I did 6 months ago?!” problem, when it comes to commits.</p>

          <p>If you ever worked on an AngularJS application that went past “Hello world!” you probably hit the service vs. factory wall. Being a vanilla JavaScript developer, it was a bit hard for me to grasp these concepts, especially because I’ve also worked with other frameworks and I had an opinion already formed about what a service should be, not to speak about the “factory pattern” that was confusing the hell out of me at that time.</p>

Throughout the post I will use ES6 syntax, but the principles outlined are available whether you’re using native JavaScript promises, or a library that implements the <a href="https://promisesaplus.com/">Promises A+ spec</a>.</p>

          <p>Developing NodeJS applications for the past year meant that I often found myself in front of monolythic applications, that clunked all-things-functionality in 3 or 4 so-called libraries.<br />
I’m not a huge fan of compiled languages, and after college I was really reluctant towards languages like Java, but one thing I really learned to  appreciate is the modularity that you can reach with it, especially with statements like <code class="highlighter-rouge">import package.*;</code>.</p>
