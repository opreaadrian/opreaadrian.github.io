          <p>Working with mapped network drives in VIM? Me too! I always wondered why go through all this pain?<br>
Because of this, I resorted to Sublime Text for this type of work, as it is very fast in most situations,
but I still dreaded the fact that I could not use Vim, as there have been some situations where I 
would have been much more productive and would have gotten to the bottom of the task way quicker if I could have used Vim instead of ST3.<br>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I find Sublime Text awesome and really fast, and yes, I am aware of its Vintage Mode, but that just 
doesn&#39;t cut it for me. I can fake Vim in Sublime, but as far as I know, ST3&#39;s Vintage  doesn&#39;t allow you to create 
custom commands/mappings, the way you do in Vim, for example.</p>

          <p>I&#39;ve always loved to call myself different names/titles. I&#39;ve been a software engineer, I&#39;ve even been a &quot;Lead Senior Front End Developer&quot;; that&#39;s a mouthful, isn&#39;t it?. 
Titles are what make people feel important in their social environment. Certain people could argue that we&#39;re rational beings, and we have values, and they&#39;re right. 
But for the majority of us, the &quot;name&quot; we&#39;re called by, is deeply engrained in our self-worth. I&#39;ve experienced this countless times. </p>

          <p>Working with SVN for the past couple of years has taught me a lot in terms of how I don&#39;t want a version control system to be. Unfortunately, many of the customers and companies I&#39;ve worked with/for have had their entire codebase on SVN, and very often I&#39;ve found myself in the situation where, after a simple merge, I&#39;d get tons of conflicts, either related to whitespace, or a specific piece of code that changes between releases (app version, for example).</p>

          <p>How many times did you find yourself in a situation where you wanted to figure out how you implemented a specific feature at some point in time, or how you implemented that bugfix 6 months ago in order to fix a bug that has been reopened? For all those situations, you probably tried to go back to the code, tried to go through your commits, and you probably ended up in a situation similar to mine.
In this article, I&#39;ll go over my research for a better commit message &quot;framework&quot;(everything is a framework these days) and how I managed to solve the &quot;I don&#39;t know what I had for lunch yesterday, how am I supposed to know what I did 6 months ago?!&quot; problem, when it comes to commits.</p>

          <p>Whether you&#39;re a developer, designer or any type of professional in the tech industry, there&#39;s one disease we all fear: <em>change</em>. Technologies, tools, languages, techniques ... all of them change literally overnight, sometimes leaving behind disappointed, frustrated people. In this article I plan on describing the actions I take when dealing with the ever changing tech world. </p>

          <p>If you ever worked on an AngularJS application that went past &quot;Hello world!&quot; you probably hit the service vs. factory wall. Being a vanilla JavaScript developer, it was a bit hard for me to grasp these concepts, especially because I&#39;ve also worked with other frameworks and I had an opinion already formed about what a service should be, not to speak about the &quot;factory pattern&quot; that was confusing the hell out of me at that time.</p>

          <p>Having worked with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">JavaScript Promises</a> extensively in the past year, I often found myself in situations where handling output and errors was very hard to perform, from a semantic standpoint.<br>
I plan on sharing my experience with promises, especially error-handling, but this is by no mean something that should be taken as a best practice, it is only my take on this issue, and you are encouraged to share your experience and practices.</p>

          <p>We use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">promises</a> in our day to day grind, and not few were the occasions in which I found promise-using code improperly structured, responses handled in an inconsistent manner, as well as weak or no error handling.<br>
With this post I aim to share some of my practices when it comes to working with promises. Throughout the post I will use ES6 syntax, but the principles outlined are available whether you&#39;re using native JavaScript promises, or a library that implements the <a href="https://promisesaplus.com/">Promises A+ spec</a>.</p>

          <p>Developing NodeJS applications for the past year meant that I often found myself in front of monolythic applications, that clunked all-things-functionality in 3 or 4 so-called libraries.<br>
I&#39;m not a huge fan of compiled languages, and after college I was really reluctant towards languages like Java, but one thing I really learned to  appreciate is the modularity that you can reach with it, especially with statements like <code>import package.*;</code>. </p>
