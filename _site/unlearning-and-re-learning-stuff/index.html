    <p>There comes a time in a developer&#39;s life when they need to unlearn something, in order to make way
for something new. In fact, I believe that the right way to learn something new, be it a new
programming technique, a new framework, a new language, sometimes means putting some concepts that
you already know and master, behind you.  </p>

<p>I actually found that many of the people I see coming up from universities struggle with this, as 
they get brainwashed with mathematics, Java and C++ and cannot accept or learn other programming 
languages.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found myself in this situation, countless times, but still haven&#39;t managed to find a solution.<br>
I love learning new stuff, and I&#39;m an avid reader, so usually when I find something I like, things 
usually happen as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>I find something I like</li>
<li>I start hacking at it and fail(I always do!)</li>
<li>I read about that technology</li>
<li>I hack some more.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s always about &quot;I&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in order to keep up with the pace of technology nowadays, we usually end up with a lot of loops
similar to the one I described above, and need to &quot;unlearn&quot; something, like I previously said.<br>
This is not necessarily a bad thing, as you need to make room for that extra knowledge, but 
sometimes you &quot;unlearn&quot; important stuff, and that&#39;s when you start losing track.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happened to me, with CSS. I invested so much time into learning backend
technologies, that I forgot how to use CSS. I realised this today, while attending 
<a href="https://twitter.com/roy">@roy</a>&#39;s talk at <a href="http://www.smartwebconf.com/">Smartweb</a>, about 
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.<br>
This felt really awkward, as I come from a front-end background, and losing track of a core 
front-end technology is not quite satisfying.<br>
I&#39;m not saying that I forgot the basic concepts, I still know what floats are, how to do 
positioning, but as you well know, technology changes at a very rapid pace, and now we have 
<code>flexbox</code>, <code>clip</code>, critical CSS, quantity queries, and CSS animations.  </p>

<p>Bottom line, I set myself to re-learn CSS, and I sure didn&#39;t know that <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> 
knows so many tricks, so I&#39;m planning to also learn to use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> better.<br>
As a closing thought, I&#39;d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/roy">@roy</a> for reminding me that some
things really don&#39;t need leave your brain, and for showing us the versatility of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. :)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
