In fact, I believe that the right way to learn something new, be it a new programming technique, a new framework, a new language, sometimes means putting some concepts that you already know and master, behind you.<p>I actually found that many of the people I see coming up from universities struggle with this, as they get brainwashed with mathematics, Java and C++ and cannot accept or learn other programming languages.<p>I’ve found myself in this situation, countless times, but still haven’t managed to find a solution.<br /> I love learning new stuff, and I’m an avid reader, so usually when I find something I like, things usually happen as follows:<ul><li>I find something I like<li>I start hacking at it and fail(I always do!)<li>I read about that technology<li>I hack some more.</ul><blockquote><p>It’s always about “I”.</blockquote><p>But in order to keep up with the pace of technology nowadays, we usually end up with a lot of loops similar to the one I described above, and need to “unlearn” something, like I previously said.<br /> This is not necessarily a bad thing, as you need to make room for that extra knowledge, but sometimes you “unlearn” important stuff, and that’s when you start losing track.<p>This is exactly what happened to me, with CSS. I invested so much time into learning backend technologies, that I forgot how to use CSS. I realised this today, while attending <a href="https://twitter.com/roy">@roy</a>’s talk at <a href="http://www.smartwebconf.com/">Smartweb</a>, about <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.<br /> This felt really awkward, as I come from a front-end background, and losing track of a core front-end technology is not quite satisfying.<br /> I’m not saying that I forgot the basic concepts, I still know what floats are, how to do positioning, but as you well know, technology changes at a very rapid pace, and now we have <code class="highlighter-rouge">flexbox</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">clip</code>, critical CSS, quantity queries, and CSS animations.<p>Bottom line, I set myself to re-learn CSS, and I sure didn’t know that <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> knows so many tricks, so I’m planning to also learn to use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> better.<br /> As a closing thought, I’d like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/roy">@roy</a> for reminding me that some things really don’t need leave your brain, and for showing us the versatility of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. :)<p>Cheers!<blockquote><p>Image credits: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jakerust/">GotCredit</a></blockquote></main><footer class="article-footer"><section><h3>Spread the word</h3><span class='st_facebook_large' displayText='Facebook'></span> <span class='st_twitter_large' displayText='Tweet'></span> <span class='st_linkedin_large' displayText='LinkedIn'></span> <span class='st_email_large' displayText='Email'></span> <span class='st_reddit_large' displayText='Reddit'></span> <span class='st_googleplus_large' displayText='Google +'></span> <span class='st_pinterest_large' displayText='Pinterest'></span></section><div class="pagination" role="navigation"> <a href="/dockerizing-adobe-media-server/" title="Previous article: Unlearning and re-learning stuff" role="prev">&larr; Dockerizing Adobe Media Server</a> <a href="/short-tip-get-docker-compose-generated-names-in-bash/" title="Next article: Unlearning and re-learning stuff" role="next">Short tip: Working with docker-compose container names &rarr;</a></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//codesinz.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></footer></article><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-32468134-4', 'auto'); ga('require', 'displayfeatures'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var _dcq = _dcq || []; var _dcs = _dcs || {}; _dcs.account = '9282313'; (function() { var dc = document.createElement('script'); dc.type = 'text/javascript'; dc.async = true; dc.src = '//tag.getdrip.com/9282313.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(dc, s); })(); </script> <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/prism.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">var switchTo5x=true;</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//ws.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">stLight.options({publisher: "92204b4b-884e-4a7f-9337-a39d86c8b368", doNotHash: true, doNotCopy: false, hashAddressBar: true, shorten: false});</script>
