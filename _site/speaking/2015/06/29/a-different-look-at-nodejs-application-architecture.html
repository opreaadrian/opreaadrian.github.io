    <p>Wednesday, June 24th, I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BucharestJS/">BucharestJS meetup</a> as a speaker, with a presentation titled <a target="_blank" title="BucharestJS presentation: A different way to node" href="http://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html">A different way to node</a>, and I had a blast sharing with people the way I do things when it comes to Node.js application architecture.<br>
In fact, I was so encouraged by their feedback that I plan on participating with more presentations on various problems that developers face, not only on the technology side, but also on the human side: motivation, health, etc.  </p>

<p>The gist of the presentation is as follows:<br>
I&#39;m one hell of a lazy developer, and I hate having to manage everything &quot;by hand&quot;. If I see myself doing something more than once, I immediately try to automate it, and that&#39;s what I did with my Node.js development workflow. I found myself in situations where I had to perform cross-directory <code>require</code> calls, and I ended up with a lot of <code>require(&#39;./../../lib/util.js&#39;);</code> and all hell broke loose when I had to reuse logic, or maintain my own code. That&#39;s exactly the reason I developed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>: to help me save time and toasted neurons.<br>
I confess, I&#39;m not less busy once I started developing with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>, as I immediately found something to do with the seconds I save by using it, but I seem to enjoy more of the things I want to do, as opposed to the things I have to do. This is precisely the effect I whish this presentation has on both attendees and regular blog readers, and I would like people to get into the mindset of sifting through the mundane quicker, and save their creative juices for the really important problems, rather than for figuring out if <code>__dirname</code> is the current directory their module is in, or if it has been reset based on where the application was instantiated.  </p>

<p>I would like to thank the organisers for having the patience and determination to keep the group alive and appealing to developers.
This article is a follow-up to my presentation and will serve as an entrypoint for people whishing to get access to the slides.</p>

<p>The slides are available here: <a target="_blank" title="BucharestJS presentation: A different way to node" href="http://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html">http://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html</a>.<br>
All the assets including the private npm repository configuration, are availble on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node">https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node</a>. There&#39;s one issue with the sinopia Dockerfile so I would recommend using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia">sinopia module from npm</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
