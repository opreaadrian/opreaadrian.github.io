If I see myself doing something more than once, I immediately try to automate it, and that’s what I did with my Node.js development workflow. I found myself in situations where I had to perform cross-directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">require</code> calls, and I ended up with a lot of <code class="highlighter-rouge">require('./../../lib/util.js');</code> and all hell broke loose when I had to reuse logic, or maintain my own code. That’s exactly the reason I developed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>: to help me save time and toasted neurons.<br /> I confess, I’m not less busy once I started developing with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>, as I immediately found something to do with the seconds I save by using it, but I seem to enjoy more of the things I want to do, as opposed to the things I have to do. This is precisely the effect I whish this presentation has on both attendees and regular blog readers, and I would like people to get into the mindset of sifting through the mundane quicker, and save their creative juices for the really important problems, rather than for figuring out if <code class="highlighter-rouge">__dirname</code> is the current directory their module is in, or if it has been reset based on where the application was instantiated.<p>I would like to thank the organisers for having the patience and determination to keep the group alive and appealing to developers. This article is a follow-up to my presentation and will serve as an entrypoint for people whishing to get access to the slides.<p>The slides are available here: <a target="_blank" title="BucharestJS presentation: A different way to node" href="https://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html">https://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html</a>.<br /> All the assets including the private npm repository configuration, are availble on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node">https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node</a>. There’s one issue with the sinopia Dockerfile so I would recommend using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia">sinopia module from npm</a>.<p>Cheers!<blockquote><p>Image credits: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/beglen/">Kate Ter Haar</a></blockquote></main><footer class="article-footer"><section><h3>Spread the word</h3><span class='st_facebook_large' displayText='Facebook'></span> <span class='st_twitter_large' displayText='Tweet'></span> <span class='st_linkedin_large' displayText='LinkedIn'></span> <span class='st_email_large' displayText='Email'></span> <span class='st_reddit_large' displayText='Reddit'></span> <span class='st_googleplus_large' displayText='Google +'></span> <span class='st_pinterest_large' displayText='Pinterest'></span></section><div class="pagination" role="navigation"> <a href="/vim-tip-working-with-network-mapped-folders/" title="Previous article: A different look at Node.js application architecture" role="prev">&larr; Vim tip: Working with network-mapped folders</a> <a href="/dockerizing-adobe-media-server/" title="Next article: A different look at Node.js application architecture" role="next">Dockerizing Adobe Media Server &rarr;</a></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//codesinz.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></footer></article><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-32468134-4', 'auto'); ga('require', 'displayfeatures'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var _dcq = _dcq || []; var _dcs = _dcs || {}; _dcs.account = '9282313'; (function() { var dc = document.createElement('script'); dc.type = 'text/javascript'; dc.async = true; dc.src = '//tag.getdrip.com/9282313.js'; var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(dc, s); })(); </script> <script type="text/javascript">var switchTo5x=true;</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//ws.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">stLight.options({publisher: "92204b4b-884e-4a7f-9337-a39d86c8b368", doNotHash: true, doNotCopy: false, hashAddressBar: true, shorten: false});</script>
