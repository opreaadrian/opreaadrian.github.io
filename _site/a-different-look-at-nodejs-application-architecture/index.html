   <main itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Wednesday, June 24th, I attended the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BucharestJS/">BucharestJS meetup</a> as a speaker, with a presentation titled <a target="_blank" title="BucharestJS presentation: A different way to node" href="https://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html">A different way to node</a>, and I had a blast sharing with people the way I do things when it comes to Node.js application architecture.<br />
In fact, I was so encouraged by their feedback that I plan on participating with more presentations on various problems that developers face, not only on the technology side, but also on the human side: motivation, health, etc.</p>

<p>The gist of the presentation is as follows:<br />
I’m one hell of a lazy developer, and I hate having to manage everything “by hand”. If I see myself doing something more than once, I immediately try to automate it, and that’s what I did with my Node.js development workflow. I found myself in situations where I had to perform cross-directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">require</code> calls, and I ended up with a lot of <code class="highlighter-rouge">require('./../../lib/util.js');</code> and all hell broke loose when I had to reuse logic, or maintain my own code. That’s exactly the reason I developed <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>: to help me save time and toasted neurons.<br />
I confess, I’m not less busy once I started developing with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/packo">packo</a>, as I immediately found something to do with the seconds I save by using it, but I seem to enjoy more of the things I want to do, as opposed to the things I have to do. This is precisely the effect I whish this presentation has on both attendees and regular blog readers, and I would like people to get into the mindset of sifting through the mundane quicker, and save their creative juices for the really important problems, rather than for figuring out if <code class="highlighter-rouge">__dirname</code> is the current directory their module is in, or if it has been reset based on where the application was instantiated.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the organisers for having the patience and determination to keep the group alive and appealing to developers.
This article is a follow-up to my presentation and will serve as an entrypoint for people whishing to get access to the slides.</p>

<p>The slides are available here: <a target="_blank" title="BucharestJS presentation: A different way to node" href="https://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html">https://codesi.nz/presentations/a-different-way-to-node/index.html</a>.<br />
All the assets including the private npm repository configuration, are availble on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node">https://github.com/opreaadrian/different-way-to-node</a>. There’s one issue with the sinopia Dockerfile so I would recommend using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia">sinopia module from npm</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
