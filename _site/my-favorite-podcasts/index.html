    <p>The one thing I absolutely love doing when I&#39;m out and about, by myself, either walking, driving or running(not that often) is to listen to podcasts.<br>
Today I&#39;m going share with you which are my favorite podcasts, but before we get to the &quot;meat&quot; of the article, I want to let you know that I created <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/great-podcasts" title="Awesome podcasts repository" target="_blank">this github repository</a> where all the podcasts mentioned in this article are listed. If you find it useful, make sure to share it with others and maybe contribute with your own preferences.  </p>

<p>The idea for this article started from a question I saw on one of the Facebook groups I follow, related specifically to the subject of podcasts. After I added my answer, I thought that it would be better if I could create a list that I could refer people to, and why not, have people contribute their own preferences.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, my list of podcasts.</p>

<h2><a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Jabber">JavaScript Jabber</a></h2>

<p>If you want to find out what are the latest and greatest in terms of JS libraries, frameworks, programming techniques, analytics tools, application monitoring, this is your go-to podcast. They have a great panel and they always invite people that are highly relevant in the JavaScript community.
They have an absolutely awesome format, that you will see in both &quot;Adventures In Angular&quot; and &quot;The Freelancers&#39; Show&quot;, and at the end of the show they do &quot;picks&quot;, so you get the chance to find out what the panelists have been reading about, book titles, articles, various services they use, or don&#39;t(that&#39;s an anti-pick :D).</p>

<h2><a href="https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular" target="_blank" title="Adventures In Angular">Adventures In Angular</a></h2>

<p>If you&#39;re all about Angular, then you have a podcast all about your beloved  framework. You&#39;ll hear about a lot of new directives, services to use in your Angular apps, performance tips, and more.<br>
Amongst the panelists you&#39;ll hear some of the people that are on <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber">JavaScript Jabber</a> as well, but they also bring in people who are very influential in the Angular community.<br>
To list some of the panelists, I would mention: <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw">Charles Max Wood</a> &mdash; initiator of <a href="https://devchat.tv">devchat.tv</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/simpulton">Lukas Ruebbelke</a> &mdash; <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> trainer, <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Papa">John Papa</a> &mdash; c&#39;mon, it&#39;s John Papa.</p>

<h2><a href="https://devchat.tv/freelancers" target="_blank" title="The Freelancers' Show">The Freelancers&#39; Show</a></h2>

<p>This one is my favorite. I&#39;ve learned so many things from this podcast, that I recently started listening to all the episodes, to make sure I haven&#39;t missed anything critical.<br>
Same as with &quot;JavaScript Jabber&quot; and &quot;Adventures In Angular&quot;, there are kind of the same people talking, they bring in other people that do freelancing, or offer various services for freelancers.<br>
I found a lot of useful things from this podcast, and only to name a few: what to bill for, how to pick your clients, keeping up to date, self-promotion,  Michael Port&#39;s &quot;Book yourself solid&quot; book.
If you&#39;re doing freelancing or planning on going freelance, I wholeheartedly recommend this podcast.</p>

<h2><a href="http://entreprogrammers.com/" target="_blank" title="Entreprogrammers Podcast">Entreprogrammers Podcast</a></h2>

<p>Again, another one about self-employment, freelancing, and the whole business of being a one-person shop. They discuss about conferences, projects they work on and share tips on how to be a better developreneur :).<br>
As for the panelists, if you used Backbone in their life, especially <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette.js</a>, then you should know who <a href="http://derickbailey.com">Derick Bailey</a> is. He used to post on <a href="https://lostechies.com/">the LosTechies blog</a> and do a lot of other cool stuff with podcasting.
You might have gotten used to Charles Max Wood by now. I don&#39;t know where does this guy get his energy from, but, then again, that&#39;s none of my business.</p>

<h2><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/" target="_blank" title="Reply All">Reply All</a></h2>

<p>This one is lighter on the brain. No programming involved, just the panelists&#39; viewpoints on the Internet, and how everything gets shaped by it.<br>
To quote their own description, &quot;Reply All is a show about the internet, hosted by PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman. It features stories about how people shape the internet, and the internet shapes people.&quot;<br>
They have other podcasts that might interest you, so feel free to <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/">check them all out</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" title="Agile Weekly Podcast">Agile Weekly Podcast</a></h2>

<p>This podcast helped me in a time where my knowledge about Agile methodologies was close to -1. It&#39;s not that active lately, and the owners left it unmaintained for quite some time, but they still have very useful info into development teams&#39; dynamics, and how stuff is supposed to work in Agile environments.</p>

<h2><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-treehouse-show" target="_blank" title="The Treehouse Show">The Treehouse Show</a></h2>

<p>If you are a frontend developer, there&#39;s a good chance you probably landed at one point on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">www.teamtreehouse.com</a> while looking for training material. If you&#39;re more into the front-end side of things, this is definitely a podcast worth checking out. It&#39;s hosted by Treehouses&#39; most prolific authors: <a href="http://nickpettit.com/">Nick Petitt</a> and <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/">Jason Seifer</a>.  </p>

<p>This is the end of my podcasts list and I&#39;m sure there are many more great podcasts and podcasters out there, so be sure to add your favorite podcast to <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/great-podcasts" title="Awesome podcasts repository" target="_blank">this github repository</a></p>
