    <p>The one thing I absolutely love doing when I’m out and about, by myself, either walking, driving or running(not that often) is to listen to podcasts.<br />
Today I’m going share with you which are my favorite podcasts, but before we get to the “meat” of the article, I want to let you know that I created <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/great-podcasts" title="Awesome podcasts repository" target="_blank">this github repository</a> where all the podcasts mentioned in this article are listed. If you find it useful, make sure to share it with others and maybe contribute with your own preferences.</p>

<p>The idea for this article started from a question I saw on one of the Facebook groups I follow, related specifically to the subject of podcasts. After I added my answer, I thought that it would be better if I could create a list that I could refer people to, and why not, have people contribute their own preferences.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, my list of podcasts.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpsdevchattvjs-jabber-targetblank-titlejavascript-jabberjavascript-jabbera"><a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Jabber">JavaScript Jabber</a></h2>

<p>If you want to find out what are the latest and greatest in terms of JS libraries, frameworks, programming techniques, analytics tools, application monitoring, this is your go-to podcast. They have a great panel and they always invite people that are highly relevant in the JavaScript community.
They have an absolutely awesome format, that you will see in both “Adventures In Angular” and “The Freelancers’ Show”, and at the end of the show they do “picks”, so you get the chance to find out what the panelists have been reading about, book titles, articles, various services they use, or don’t(that’s an anti-pick :D).<br />
Besides the regular panelists, one of them struck me as being a highly ambitious and motivated person — <a href="https://twitter.com/Aimee_Knight">Aimee Knight</a>. The reason for my admiration is that before becoming a developer, she was a figure skater and in my opinion, it takes a lot of courage and effort to make that kind of switch; it’s totally different from becoming a developer after working as an accountant.<br />
Aimee gave a great talk at <a href="http://angularconnect.com/">AngularConnect 2015</a> titled “Getting Comfortable Being Uncomfortable”, available on Youtube, so check it out:  <a href="https://youtu.be/B22o_yeDE_s">https://youtu.be/B22o_yeDE_s</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpsdevchattvadventures-in-angular-targetblank-titleadventures-in-angularadventures-in-angulara"><a href="https://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular" target="_blank" title="Adventures In Angular">Adventures In Angular</a></h2>

<p>If you’re all about Angular, then you have a podcast all about your beloved  framework. You’ll hear about a lot of new directives, services to use in your Angular apps, performance tips, and more.<br />
Amongst the panelists you’ll hear some of the people that are on <a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber">JavaScript Jabber</a> as well, but they also bring in people who are very influential in the Angular community.<br />
To list some of the panelists, I would mention: <a href="https://twitter.com/cmaxw">Charles Max Wood</a> — initiator of <a href="https://devchat.tv">devchat.tv</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/simpulton">Lukas Ruebbelke</a> — <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> trainer, <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Papa">John Papa</a> — c’mon, it’s John Papa.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpsdevchattvfreelancers-targetblank-titlethe-freelancers-showthe-freelancers-showa"><a href="https://devchat.tv/freelancers" target="_blank" title="The Freelancers' Show">The Freelancers’ Show</a></h2>

<p>This one is my favorite. I’ve learned so many things from this podcast, that I recently started listening to all the episodes, to make sure I haven’t missed anything critical.<br />
Same as with “JavaScript Jabber” and “Adventures In Angular”, there are kind of the same people talking, they bring in other people that do freelancing, or offer various services for freelancers.<br />
I found a lot of useful things from this podcast, and only to name a few: what to bill for, how to pick your clients, keeping up to date, self-promotion,  <a href="http://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/" title="Link to Book yourself solid website" target="_blank">Michael Port’s “Book yourself solid” program</a>.
If you’re doing freelancing or planning on going freelance, I wholeheartedly recommend this podcast.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpentreprogrammerscom-targetblank-titleentreprogrammers-podcastentreprogrammers-podcasta"><a href="http://entreprogrammers.com/" target="_blank" title="Entreprogrammers Podcast">Entreprogrammers Podcast</a></h2>

<p>Again, another one about self-employment, freelancing, and the whole business of being a one-person shop. They discuss about conferences, projects they work on and share tips on how to be a better developreneur :).<br />
As for the panelists, if you used Backbone in their life, especially <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette.js</a>, then you should know who <a href="http://derickbailey.com">Derick Bailey</a> is. He used to post on <a href="https://lostechies.com/">the LosTechies blog</a> and do a lot of other cool stuff with podcasting.
You might have gotten used to Charles Max Wood by now. I don’t know where does this guy get his energy from, but, then again, that’s none of my business.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpsgimletmediacomshowreply-all-targetblank-titlereply-allreply-alla"><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/" target="_blank" title="Reply All">Reply All</a></h2>

<p>This one is lighter on the brain. No programming involved, just the panelists’ viewpoints on the Internet, and how everything gets shaped by it.<br />
To quote their own description, “Reply All is a show about the internet, hosted by PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman. It features stories about how people shape the internet, and the internet shapes people.”<br />
They have other podcasts that might interest you, so feel free to <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/">check them all out</a></p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpintegrumtechcomcategoryagile-weekly-podcast-targetblank-titleagile-weekly-podcastagile-weekly-podcasta"><a href="http://integrumtech.com/category/agile-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" title="Agile Weekly Podcast">Agile Weekly Podcast</a></h2>

<p>This podcast helped me in a time where my knowledge about Agile methodologies was close to -1. It’s not that active lately, and the owners left it unmaintained for quite some time, but they still have very useful info into development teams’ dynamics, and how stuff is supposed to work in Agile environments.</p>

<h2 id="a-hrefhttpsteamtreehousecomlibrarythe-treehouse-show-targetblank-titlethe-treehouse-showthe-treehouse-showa"><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-treehouse-show" target="_blank" title="The Treehouse Show">The Treehouse Show</a></h2>

<p>If you are a frontend developer, there’s a good chance you probably landed at one point on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">www.teamtreehouse.com</a> while looking for training material. If you’re more into the front-end side of things, this is definitely a podcast worth checking out. It’s hosted by Treehouses’ most prolific authors: <a href="http://nickpettit.com/">Nick Petitt</a> and <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/">Jason Seifer</a>.</p>

<p>This is the end of my podcasts list and I’m sure there are many more great podcasts and podcasters out there, so be sure to add your favorite podcast to <a href="https://github.com/opreaadrian/great-podcasts" title="Awesome podcasts repository" target="_blank">this github repository</a></p>
