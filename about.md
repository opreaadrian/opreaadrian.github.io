Hi, I'm Adrian, I'm a 27 yo. web developer with 6+ years of experience. I'm into sports, I like running and basketball, and when I'm (rarely) away from my computer I love to spend time with my daughter and my wife. Find out more about me/my work on my LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub profiles.

Oh, and I really love JavaScript, Vim, HTML and the Open Web!
