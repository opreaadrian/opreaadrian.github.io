A week ago I saw a very interesting question on Quora, titled:  [What should I do to become an enterprise level professional in JavaScript?](https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-do-to-become-an-enterprise-level-professional-in-JavaScript/). In this article, you will find my answer to this question, as I intend to keep it as a reference for everybody interested in the subject. I'd like to mention that writing this answer was highly beneficial for me, as I had to look back at my past and think about my actions and how they determined the path that I took in my career as a software development professional.
One thing worth mentioning is the fact that I don't yet consider myself an "enterprise JavaScript developer", even though I have been called by that name. I'm a software developer with a sweet tooth for JavaScript, that's it.

## The actual answer
First and foremost let me start by saying that I met "enterprise JavaScript" developers who are not that skilled in JavaScript, simply because the "enterprise" limits all their creativity by being more restrictive in terms of technologies.
On the other hand, they tend to be good at overall architecture, they think a lot in terms of scalability and durability.

Now, on to the list:

1. Learn JavaScript. I mean it! Learn the language, how it works, what is lexical scoping, how do all the data types work.
2. Find some coding standards documents - there are quite a few - and take the gist from all of them(i'll provide a list at the end)
3. Learn some utility libraries like jQuery, lodash,  zepto
4. Learn object-oriented programming
5. Learn functional programming
6. Learn a framework or two - at least the basic concepts - Angular and React are good candidates for that.
7. Learn design pattenrs - [Essential JavaScript Design patterns by Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
8. Look at the frameworks again, from a different perspective, that of the implementation
9. Learn how to optimize for performance, in the browser
10. Learn NodeJS, if you plan on going full stack
11. Find some interesting, open source projects that you can work on, or create your own.
12. Read a lot of code - get a project that you like and simply observe the structure, the patterns, the coding style.
13. Write a lot of code - nothing sticks unless you use it, reading is not enough, you need to write JavaScript, day-in-day-out
14. Be humble. Don't think that if you know a lot, you're better than others. We tend to fall into this trap too often.
15. Share your knowledge. Blog, tweet, go to meetups and give presentations do podcasting, whatever your preferred method of expression is

One last thing: don't go learning everything out there in terms of frameworks, if you're not planning on using them.
You will only waste precious time and memory on useless stuff. Set small(reaaaaally small) achievable goals for yourself and make sure you stick to them.

Good luck!
