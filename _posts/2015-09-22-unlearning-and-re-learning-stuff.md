There comes a time in a developer's life when they need to unlearn something, in order to make way
for something new. In fact, I believe that the right way to learn something new, be it a new
programming technique, a new framework, a new language, sometimes means putting some concepts that
you already know and master, behind you.  

I actually found that many of the people I see coming up from universities struggle with this, as 
they get brainwashed with mathematics, Java and C++ and cannot accept or learn other programming 
languages.  

I've found myself in this situation, countless times, but still haven't managed to find a solution.  
I love learning new stuff, and I'm an avid reader, so usually when I find something I like, things 
usually happen as follows:

* I find something I like
* I start hacking at it and fail(I always do!)
* I read about that technology
* I hack some more.

> It's always about "I".  

But in order to keep up with the pace of technology nowadays, we usually end up with a lot of loops
similar to the one I described above, and need to "unlearn" something, like I previously said.  
This is not necessarily a bad thing, as you need to make room for that extra knowledge, but 
sometimes you "unlearn" important stuff, and that's when you start losing track.

This is exactly what happened to me, with CSS. I invested so much time into learning backend
technologies, that I forgot how to use CSS. I realised this today, while attending 
[@roy](https://twitter.com/roy)'s talk at [Smartweb](http://www.smartwebconf.com/), about 
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).  
This felt really awkward, as I come from a front-end background, and losing track of a core 
front-end technology is not quite satisfying.  
I'm not saying that I forgot the basic concepts, I still know what floats are, how to do 
positioning, but as you well know, technology changes at a very rapid pace, and now we have 
`flexbox`, `clip`, critical CSS, quantity queries, and CSS animations.  

Bottom line, I set myself to re-learn CSS, and I sure didn't know that [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 
knows so many tricks, so I'm planning to also learn to use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) better.  
As a closing thought, I'd like to thank [@roy](https://twitter.com/roy) for reminding me that some
things really don't need leave your brain, and for showing us the versatility of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). :)

Cheers!
