	<h1>Who am I?</h1>

	<p>
	I am a web consultant helping businesses get their web applications ready for the future through
	cutivating healthy development practices, setting up continuous integration environments and training. 
During the past 7+ years I've been working as a software developer I gained expertise in web application development,
scalability and setting up development processes to reduce and prevent technical debt. <br>I've set up continuous integration systems and dealt with the cultural aspect of adopting a DevOps mentality among development teams.<br>
I love to share knowledge, so writing is one of my biggest passions. I write a lot on my blog, I am a regular speaker
at local meetups and I feel perfectly comfortable talking in front of people.
