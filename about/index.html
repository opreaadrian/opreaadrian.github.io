<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
Hello, I'm Adrian, I'm a web application developer who helps businesses
get the most outcome possible from their websites or web appilcations
By combining cutting edge technologies and techniques with common
sense and collaboration, I help businesses improve their web application
performance, as well as develop new features or improve the usability of their
web applications.
Apart from web application development, I help businesses embrace the DevOps
mindset and deal with the cultural aspects involved, when making the shift.
During my 7+ years as a web developer I gathered valuable knowledge that
enables me to bring high value to the projects I work on.
I am actively involved in the JavaScript community, both online and through local
user groups/meetups, as well as other communities, tangential to the technology field.
I am also a regular speaker at meetups and I like to share my experiences with people
through <a href="/">my blog</a>.
</p>

<p>If you need help with your website or web application, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
If you don't feel like contacting me just yet, but would like to get <b>frequent updates
  on the state of web technologies and DevOps</b>, <a href="/newsletter">subscribe to my newsletter</a>.</p>
